# 3rd Party WhatsApp (FastAPI, Flowise) Integration

This project provides a FastAPI-based webhook for integrating WhatsApp messaging with an external AI or automation API. When a user sends a message to your WhatsApp number, the webhook receives the message, forwards it to an external API for processing, and sends the API's response back to the user on WhatsApp.

## Get Started

1. **Overview & Setup**: Begin your journey [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started).
2. **Locate Your Bots**: Your bots can be found [here](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/).
3. **WhatsApp API Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with the [official documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp).
4. **Helpful Guide**: Here's a [Python-based guide](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2022/10/24/sending-messages-with-whatsapp-in-your-python-applications/) for sending messages.
5. **API Docs for Sending Messages**: Check out [this documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/send-messages).

## Step 1: Select Phone Numbers

- Make sure WhatsApp is added to your App.
- You begin with a test number that you can use to send messages to up to 5 numbers.
- Go to API Setup and locate the test number from which you will be sending messages.
- Here, you can also add numbers to send messages to. Enter your **own WhatsApp number**.
- You will receive a code on your phone via WhatsApp to verify your number.

## Step 2: Send Messages with the API

1. Obtain a 24-hour access token from the API access section.
2. It will show an example of how to send messages using a `curl` command which can be send from the terminal or with a tool like Postman.
3. Let's convert that into a [Python function with the request library](https://github.com/daveebbelaar/python-whatsapp-bot/blob/main/start/whatsapp_quickstart.py).
4. Create a `.env` files based on `example.env` and update the required variables. [Video example here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOwG0bw0RNU).
5. You will receive a "Hello World" message (Expect a 60-120 second delay for the message).

Creating an access that works longer then 24 hours
1. Create a [system user at the Meta Business account level](https://business.facebook.com/settings/system-users).
2. On the System Users page, configure the assets for your System User, assigning your WhatsApp app with full control. Don't forget to click the Save Changes button.
   - [See step 1 here](https://github.com/daveebbelaar/python-whatsapp-bot/blob/main/img/meta-business-system-user-token.png)
   - [See step 2 here](https://github.com/daveebbelaar/python-whatsapp-bot/blob/main/img/adding-assets-to-system-user.png)
3. Now click `Generate new token` and select the app, and then choose how long the access token will be valid. You can choose 60 days or never expire.
4. Select all the permissions, as I was running into errors when I only selected the WhatsApp ones.
5. Confirm and copy the access token.

Now we have to find the following information on the **App Dashboard**:

- **APP_ID**: "<YOUR-WHATSAPP-BUSINESS-APP_ID>" (Found at App Dashboard)
- **APP_SECRET**: "<YOUR-WHATSAPP-BUSINESS-APP_SECRET>" (Found at App Dashboard)
- **RECIPIENT_WAID**: "<YOUR-RECIPIENT-TEST-PHONE-NUMBER>" (This is your WhatsApp ID, i.e., phone number. Make sure it is added to the account as shown in the example test message.)
- **VERSION**: "v18.0" (The latest version of the Meta Graph API)
- **ACCESS_TOKEN**: "<YOUR-SYSTEM-USER-ACCESS-TOKEN>" (Created in the previous step)

> You can only send a template type message as your first message to a user. That's why you have to send a reply first before we continue. Took me 2 hours to figure this out.


## Step 3: Configure Webhooks to Receive Messages

> Please note, this is the hardest part of this tutorial.

## Features

- **Webhook Verification**: Handles WhatsApp webhook verification with Meta.
- **Message Handling**: Receives WhatsApp messages, extracts the sender and message text.
- **External API Integration**: Forwards incoming messages to an external API (e.g., AI chatbot) and retrieves the response.
- **Automated Replies**: Sends the API's response back to the original sender on WhatsApp.
- **Logging**: Logs all incoming requests and outgoing responses for debugging and monitoring.

## Folder Structure

```
whatsapp-test/
â”œâ”€â”€ webhook.py
â”œâ”€â”€ webhook_2.py
â”œâ”€â”€ app.log
â”œâ”€â”€ .env
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- WhatsApp Business API or WhatsApp Cloud API credentials
- External API endpoint for processing messages (e.g., AI chatbot)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or similar tool for local development (optional)

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/whatsapp-webhook-fastapi.git
cd whatsapp-webhook-fastapi/whatsapp-test
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-dotenv requests
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project directory with the following content:

```
MYTOKEN=your_webhook_verify_token
WHATSAPP_TOKEN=your_whatsapp_api_token
PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your_whatsapp_phone_number_id
PORT=8000
```

- `MYTOKEN`: Token for webhook verification with Meta.
- `WHATSAPP_TOKEN`: Your WhatsApp API access token.
- `PHONE_NUMBER_ID`: Your WhatsApp phone number ID.
- `PORT`: Port to run the FastAPI server (default: 8000).

### 4. Update API URLs

In `webhook_2.py`, update these variables:

```python
API_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/prediction/your-model-id"  # Your external API endpoint
WHATSAPP_API_URL = "https://graph.facebook.com/v22.0/{PHONE_NUMBER_ID}/messages"
```

Replace `{PHONE_NUMBER_ID}` with your actual phone number ID or use the environment variable.

---

## Running the Server

```bash
uvicorn webhook_2:app --reload --port 8000
```

---

## Exposing the Webhook (for Meta/WhatsApp)

If running locally, use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your server:

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

Copy the HTTPS URL provided by ngrok and use it as your webhook URL in the WhatsApp Business API dashboard.

---

## Endpoints

### `GET /webhook`

- Used by Meta to verify your webhook.
- Requires query parameters: `hub.mode`, `hub.challenge`, `hub.verify_token`.

### `POST /webhook`

- Receives WhatsApp messages.
- Extracts the sender's number and message text.
- Forwards the message to your external API.
- Sends the API's `"text"` response back to the sender on WhatsApp.

### `GET /`

- Health check endpoint. Returns a welcome message.

---

## Example Workflow

1. User sends "Hello" to your WhatsApp number.
2. WhatsApp forwards the message to your webhook (`POST /webhook`).
3. The webhook extracts the message and sender, sends the message to your external API.
4. The external API responds with a JSON like:
    ```json
    {
      "text": "Bonjour! ðŸŒŸ Welcome to your cozy Parisian getaway! ...",
      "question": "Hello",
      ...
    }
    ```
5. The webhook sends only the `"text"` value back to the user on WhatsApp.

---

## Logging

All requests and responses are logged to `app.log` and the console for debugging.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Webhook Not Verified**: Ensure `MYTOKEN` matches the token set in the Meta dashboard.
- **No Response Sent**: Check logs for extraction errors or API failures.
- **WhatsApp API Errors**: Ensure your `WHATSAPP_TOKEN` and `PHONE_NUMBER_ID` are correct and have permission to send messages.
